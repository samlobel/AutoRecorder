#Autorecorder
####Continuous background recording for jamming

A lot of times I'll be playing music and play something that sounds good, but when I try to do it again it's not quite the same. I made this app so that I'll always be able to go back and listen, without having to have the forsight to press record.

Running this app creates a small icon in the menu bar, which you click to export the last 5 minutes of microphone audio to a file on your desktop. It's easiest if you make this app appear on login (System Preferences/Users and Groups/Login items), so that you don't have to think about starting it up.
